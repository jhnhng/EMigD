#' Function arguments #

#' @param emd Either the between time frame (e.g., winter season to the summer season)
#'  emd or the within-time frame (e.g., first 10-days to the second 10-days) emd
#' @param t1 First list of data frames, where each element represents an interval
#'  or time frame (e.g., first 10-day period to second 10-day period or
#'  winter to summer)
#' @param t2 Second list of data frames, where each element represents an interval or
#'  time frame (e.g., first 10-day period to second 10-day period or winter to
#'  summer)
#'
#'  @returns Matrices of the emspeeds (EMDs/Difference between the two)
